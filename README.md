# Project Name

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This site is being built so that we can get hands on experience with backend systems and produce a product that pulls from multiple databases and updates the information pulled regularly.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
step 1: Copy base code from our Repo.
step 2: In terminal window 'npm install dotenv' and create '.env' file containing PORT='port number you use'.
step 3: Run nodemon and test routes (location) and outputs.
step 4: deploy if desired.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
Langauges currently in use include, JavaScript, node, express, dotEnv, JSON, CORS.



## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.

## Credits and Collaborations
