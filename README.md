## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This site is being built so that we can get hands on experience with backend systems and produce a product that pulls from multiple databases and updates the information pulled regularly.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
step 1: Copy base code from our Repo.
step 2: In terminal window 'npm install dotenv' and create '.env' file containing PORT='port number you use'.
step 3: Run nodemon and test routes (location) and outputs.
step 4: deploy if desired.

## Architecture

Langauges currently in use include, JavaScript, node, express, dotEnv, JSON, CORS.
